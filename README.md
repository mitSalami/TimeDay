> A plugin to let your player vote to Change the Time of day. Currently only changing the time to day is supported. Other votes will be added in later version. if you find any bugs please create a Issue here.

## Usage

```sh
Players can start a vote with the /voteday command.  
Other people can then vote yes by using the /vote [yes|no] command.  
The threshold that the vote is successful is half the players.  
This will be changed in later version so that it's customizable.
```
